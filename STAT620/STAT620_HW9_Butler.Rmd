### (Alternative to 6.7) Does a continuous distribution function have to be uniformly continuous? If yes, prove, if no, give a counterexample.

*Note: Problem 6.7 implies that if $F$ is a continuous distribution function on $\mathbb{R}$, it must be uniformly conintinous*

The notes define a distribution function to be a function $F:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ that is a monotone increasing, right-continuous function. If $F$ is continuous, then it is both right-continuous and left-continuous at every point. A function that is uniformly continuous is one such that for any given $\varepsilon >0$, there can be found a single $\delta >0$ such that $|F(x) - F(x_0)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $|x - x_0| < \delta$, for all $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$.

A continuous distribution function must be continuous at every point $x$.
